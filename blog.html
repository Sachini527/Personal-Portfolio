                <p>HTML5, the latest version of HTML, offers significant improvements over its predecessor. It
                    simplifies the DOCTYPE declaration, introduces semantic elements for better structure and
                    accessibility, and provides native support for multimedia like audio and video. HTML5 also extends
                    form capabilities with new input types, offers local storage and application cache for offline data,
                    and provides tools for creating dynamic graphics and vector graphics. Additionally, it includes a
                    Geolocation API, Web Workers for background tasks, a Drag and Drop API, and encourages the use of
                    semantic HTML for better SEO and accessibility.</p>

                <h2>CSS Layouts</h2>
                <time datetime="2024-08-27">August 27, 2024</time>
                <p>CSS layouts are essential for structuring and positioning content on web pages, providing control
                    over how elements are displayed and interact with each other. CSS layout techniques include Flexbox
                    and CSS Grid, which offer flexible, responsive design capabilities. Flexbox is ideal for
                    one-dimensional layouts, such as aligning items in a row or column with options like justify-content
                    and align-items to manage spacing and alignment effectively. CSS Grid, on the other hand, is
                    designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing developers to create complex grid structures by
                    defining rows and columns that can adjust dynamically to fit various screen sizes. Additionally,
                    positioning properties like absolute, relative, and fixed provide precise control over an element's
                    placement, while media queries enable responsive designs that adapt to different devices. By
                    combining these layout techniques, CSS allows for creative, efficient, and responsive web designs
                    that enhance user experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.</p>

                <p>The Doc-Connect Healthcare Application is a Java-based system for managing doctor availability and
                    patient appointments, supporting both general and referral bookings. Using Object-Oriented
                    principles, it features a simple text-based interface and organized scheduling with ArrayList and
                    HashMap to prevent double-booking, making it efficient for healthcare management. https://github.com/Sachini527/Healthcare-Application</p>
